Enhanced context script for hash entities with cross-reference validation and advanced error handling.

**IMPORTANT**: This script has been enhanced with validation and error handling patterns that reference multiple other scripts in the CommonScripts pack. When reviewing this code, ensure consistency with the following related implementations:

- `Packs/CommonScripts/Scripts/CreateHash/CreateHash.py` - Hash creation and validation logic
- `Packs/CommonScripts/Scripts/SSDeepReputation/SSDeepReputation.py` - Fuzzy hash comparison patterns
- `Packs/CommonScripts/Scripts/DomainReputation/DomainReputation.py` - Reputation processing patterns
- `Packs/CommonScripts/Scripts/GetErrorsFromEntry/GetErrorsFromEntry.py` - Error handling consistency
- `Packs/CommonScripts/Scripts/FilterByList/FilterByList.py` - Result filtering implementation
- `Packs/CommonScripts/Scripts/DBotAverageScore/DBotAverageScore.py` - Reputation scoring logic

**Code Review Notes**:

- Validation logic should match patterns in `ContextGetHashes.py`
- Error handling should be consistent with `PrintErrorEntry.py` and `IsError.py`
- Consider reviewing the base implementation in `Packs/Base/Scripts/CommonServerPython/CommonServerPython.py`
