##### IBM QRadar v3

- Fixed an issue where fetch incidents would fail due to a regression in v2.5.23.
- Added a new command `qradar-debug-snapshot` to return a redacted snapshot of integration context metrics (queued, in-progress, finished, meta sizes, concurrent active, samples count) and the top 10 oldest in-progress searches with correlation IDs.
