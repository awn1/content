Every infra MR must have a changelog. Changelogs are saved under the `.changelogs` folder until the next infra release.
To create a changelog, choose one of:

**Manually**
Create a file using the following format: `<Jira issue number>.<category>.md` under `.changelogs`. (e.g. `CIAC-11444.doc.md`)
The _category_ can be one of `feature`, `bugfix`, `doc`, `removal` or `misc`.
In the file, type a brief one-line changelog for each change.

**Interactively**
0. Make sure you're in an updated Poetry environment (pull from infra master, `poetry install`)
1. Run `poetry run towncrier create` _(or `poetry shell` and then `towncrier create`)_
2. Insert the relevant Jira issue as the issue (e.g. `CIAC-0000`) - this will be the file name
3. Choose the issue type (feature, bugfix, etc)
4. Briefly describe every change in a separate own line.
A file will be added to `.changelogs/`.
